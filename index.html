                              <p>Employee engagement web application written using C# on ASP.NET and hosted with Azure. 
                                 Coordinated with a small agile team to implement a RESTful API used by our mobile app and third parties. 
                                 Communicated with vendors to build out SSO workflows, push notifications, and ETL pipelines.
                                 Worked on continual improvements to the sites architectural scalability to meet the constantly increasing traffic.
                                 Back-end development interfaced with both MongoDB and SQL data layers which also included a Redis cache intermediate layer.
                                 Front-end development included several javascript libraries; knockout.js being the primary view-model framework. 
                                 Introduced asynchronous programming standards, queued tasks, and globalization/DateTime localization to the company which helped scalability and usability.
                                 When Brand Integrity was acquired in 2018, I learned PHP 7 to fill the feature gap between the two platform's surveys and reporting.
